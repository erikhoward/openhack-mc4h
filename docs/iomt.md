# IoMT Introduction 
The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) represents the advent of wireless connectivity for medical as well as consumer-grade devices in the healthcare space. IoMT devices range from clinical vital signs monitors to popular consumer products, and the increase in their use, both in clinical and non-clinical settings, has led to a staggering increase in the amount of health data collected year over year. It has become an HLS industry imperative to utilize IoMT data to its fullest potential.

Azure Healthcare APIs and its suite of supporting tools offers a comprehensive solution for ingesting, persisting, and harvesting IoMT data on a massive scale. The IoMT Connector for Azure (OSS) gives implementors a vast array of IoMT connectivity options, whether through IoT Hub, IoT Central, or directly into Event Hubs. When deployed with FHIR Proxy, Azure API for FHIR and the IoMT Connector for Azure can be configured for IoMT-triggered eventing workflows.
