Microsoft's Cloud for Healthcare healthcare data store is **Azure API for FHIR**, while leveraging the **Dynamics** Industry data model for health.  Synchronizing data between these two data models requires several layers of mapping, most of which is setup, managed and controlled via the SyncAdmin for FHIR Page in Dynamics.
