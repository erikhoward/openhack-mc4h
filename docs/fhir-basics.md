# FHIR® Introduction 
The healthcare industry is undergoing a rapid transformation in its adoption of the [FHIR®](https://hl7.org/fhir/) (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standard for health data storage and exchange. FHIR brings the industry a robust, extensible data model with standardized semantics and a shared format for greater data mobility, enabling all systems using FHIR to work together. At the core of MC4H capabilities is the FHIR data support provided by Azure API for FHIR and accompanying tools.

Transforming your data into FHIR allows you to quickly connect existing data sources such as electronic health record (EHR) systems or research databases, opening new channels of health data interoperability. FHIR also makes provisions for the secure exchange of health data to and from personal devices, letting health data flow outside traditional clinical settings. Once ingested, FHIR can simplify the extraction of health insights in analytics and machine learning pipelines.
