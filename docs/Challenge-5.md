# Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare OpenHack

## FHIR SyncAgent
[View Repo on GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/openhack-mc4h/tree/main/Challenge-05){: .btn }

The goal of the FHIR-SyncAgent is to sychronize health data between Azure API for FHIR and Dataverse' Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare securely and seemlessly. Applications built on the Dynamics platform (which include Dynamics Model applications) or ones that make use of Dataverse can operate with the FHIR-SyncAgnet without need of making REST API calls directly to Azure API for FHIR. In addition to running Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare pre-built app solutions, developers can also take advantage of the Dynamics 365 low-code/no-code environment to build solutions that can read & write data to the Azure API for FHIR.
