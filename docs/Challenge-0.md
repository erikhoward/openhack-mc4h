# Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare OpenHack

## Welcome!
This OpenHack is a series of hands on activities for you to get direct experience working with Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare (MC4H) tools and architectures.

## What to expect 
+ Each hack will introduce part of the MC4H health data workflow and present a challenge for you to work on using MC4H tools.
+ Challenges will require you to deploy and configure MC4H solutions with only the published documentation as a guide.
+ The tasks give you a chance to exercise your problem solving skills. Group work on the challenges is encouraged.

## Where to start 
Start here and take a quick tour through the challenge topics. When you are ready, begin with the first challenge: "Deploy FHIR".

The challenge topics build on each other, and it is recommended to go through the challenges in the order they are presented on this site. For example, completing the task in the first challenge is necessary before moving on to other challenges.

## What you will learn 
+ What FHIR is and how it enables health data interoperability
+ How Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare solutions are implemented in the Health and Life Sciences (HLS) industry
+ How to build pipelines connecting Azure API for FHIR to MS Azure's suite of enterprise analytics tools
+ How to ingest IoMT data and trigger near-real-time alerts
+ What DICOM is and how it is integrated into MC4H solutions
